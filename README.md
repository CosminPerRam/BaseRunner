# BaseRunner
BaseRunner is a Stealth-based top-bottom 2D game which is being developed over the winter break of 2019 (23.12 - 13.01) as a game project challenge.

The game is not ready yet, you can attempt to build it and run it but you'll probably fail lol.

# Info
The game is purely made in C/C++ using a number of open source projects:
* [Simple Fast Multimedia Layer][sfml]
* [Nlohmann JSON][nlohmann-json]

And uses some bits from here to there from:
* [Hopson97's Basic Game Framework][hopson-engine]
